## Key Quantum Concepts

### Shor's Algorithm
Shor's algorithm provides exponential speedup for integer factorization, the mathematical foundation of RSA encryption security.

**Implementation**: 
- Uses quantum superposition to test multiple factors simultaneously
- Employs Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for period finding
- Demonstrates why RSA will be vulnerable to large-scale quantum computers

```python
def create_shors_circuit():
    qc = QuantumCircuit(4, 4)
    # Superposition for period finding
    qc.h(0)
    qc.h(1)
    # Modular exponentiation (simplified for N=15)
    qc.cx(0, 2)
    qc.cx(1, 3)
    qc.cp(np.pi/2, 0, 1)
    # Inverse QFT for period extraction
    qc.h(1)
    qc.cp(-np.pi/2, 0, 1)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.measure_all()
    return qc
```

### Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)
QNNs leverage quantum entanglement and superposition for pattern recognition in cryptographic analysis.

**Implementation**:
- **Parameterized Quantum Circuits**: Trainable quantum gates (RY, RZ rotations)
- **Quantum Entanglement**: CNOT gates create correlations impossible in classical networks
- **Variational Training**: Classical optimization of quantum parameters

```python
class QuantumNeuralNetwork:
    def create_circuit(self, params, input_features):
        qc = QuantumCircuit(self.num_qubits, 1)
        
        # Input encoding via rotation gates
        for i, feature in enumerate(input_features):
            qc.ry(feature * np.pi, i)
            
        # Variational layers with entanglement
        param_idx = 0
        for layer in range(self.num_layers):
            # Create quantum entanglement
            for i in range(self.num_qubits - 1):
                qc.cx(i, i + 1)
            qc.cx(self.num_qubits - 1, 0)  # Ring connectivity
            
            # Trainable parameters
            for i in range(self.num_qubits):
                qc.ry(params[param_idx], i)
                param_idx += 1
                qc.rz(params[param_idx], i)
                param_idx += 1
        
        qc.measure(self.num_qubits - 1, 0)
        return qc
```
